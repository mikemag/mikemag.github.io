## Computer Science Videos

I’ve started trying to create short videos explaining some concepts in CS that I think would benefit from a bit of animation.

I’ve started with one topic based on what I saw in the AP CS class recently and have been branching out from there. 
I’m using Manim and I have a fork of it and the source for my videos so far
at https://github.com/mikemag/manim/tree/cse/cs_education

These are the videos so far. All are "in beta" and subjet to change:
* Call Stacks (3:00): [https://youtu.be/kfYNHAOC0qc](https://youtu.be/kfYNHAOC0qc)
* Recursion Part 1 (4:19): [https://youtu.be/bOcQTyihplA](https://youtu.be/bOcQTyihplA)
* Recursion Part 2 (3:34): [https://youtu.be/7BDdu2es87Y](https://youtu.be/7BDdu2es87Y)
* Merge Sort Part 1 (3:12): [https://youtu.be/YMXKthdwSig](https://youtu.be/YMXKthdwSig)

Here's an example snippet of some of the Python used to create these, in this case a class to represent a visual for an array using Manim:

And a bit of one of the animations of the merge phase of a merge sort:

That's all for now!
