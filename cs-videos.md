## Computer Science Videos

I’ve started trying to create short videos explaining some concepts in CS that I think would benefit from a bit of animation.

I’ve started with one topic based on what I saw in the AP CS class recently. 
I’m using Manim and I have a fork of it here and the source for my first video up 
at https://github.com/mikemag/manim/tree/master/cs_education




A bit of Python, a class to represent a visual for an array using Manim:

And a bit of one of the animations of the merge phase of a merge sort:

That's all for now!
