## Computer Science Videos

I’ve started trying to create short videos explaining some concepts in CS that I think would benefit from a bit of animation.

I’ve started with one topic based on what I saw in the AP CS class recently and have been branching out from there. 
I’m using Manim for the animations. All of the source for my videos so far
is at https://github.com/mikemag/CS-Videos

I'm putting the videos up on my YouTube channel here: https://youtube.com/TheMikemag

Here's an example snippet of some of the Python used to create these, in this case a class to represent a visual for an array using Manim:

And a bit of one of the animations of the merge phase of a merge sort:

That's all for now!
